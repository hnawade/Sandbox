# Sandbox

This project is a collection of a few tidbits of Java code, I have written for fun over the past six years. In this Readme, for each file in /src, I will explain the purpose of the file and its classes.

### Euler

The Euler package contains some of my solutions to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net) The ProjEuler class contains the main method that can be edited to call the main methods of any of the other classes in the file. All classes starting with "problem" represent a solution to a Project Euler problem. 

In the PI class, I devised three methods for approximating the value of pi. The first two rely only on trigonometric approximations. The third method uses the Taylor expansion for the inverse trigonometric functions.

### Test

The test package contains miscellaneous code that I made for fun.

#### AK_sum

This method sums all the integers from the first integer passed in to the second integer with O(n) runtime.

#### C1

The classes in this file are completely unconnected; in the past, I have used this file as a way to experiment quickly in Java. Some of the basic things that I've experimented with in this file are ArrayLists (in ArrayListClass, C2), a 4-operation 2-input console calculator (Calc), factorials (fact), storing matrices (matrix), BigIntegers (bignumber). I've also experimented with different runtime algorithms for calculating the fibonacci sequence, and runtimes for mergesort and Inversion sort.

#### Other

The Encapsulation.java file contains an example of encapsulation to explore how the consequences of encapsulation.

The CartTest.java file contains tests I use as examples to teach objects and classes to my students.
